        ## Troubleshoot
        If `jest-preset-angular` is not behaving the way you expect, we'd ask you to look at the [documentation](https://thymikee.github.io/jest-preset-angular) and search the issue tracker for evidence supporting your expectation. Please make reasonable efforts to troubleshoot and rule out issues with your code, the configuration, or any 3rd party libraries you might be using.

        ## Ask for help through appropriate channels
        If you feel unsure about the cause of the problem, consider asking for help on for example [StackOverflow](https://stackoverflow.com/questions/ask) or our [Discord channel](https://discord.gg/j6FKKQQrW9) before posting a bug report. The issue tracker is not a help forum.

        ## Make a minimal reproduction
        To file the report, you will need a GitHub repository with a minimal (but complete) example and simple/clear steps on how to reproduce the bug. If all your tests fail with a strange error, can you find a way to show us with just one? If you have many configuration options in your `jest.config.js`, can you simplify it?

        The simpler you can make it, the more likely we are to successfully verify and fix the bug.
