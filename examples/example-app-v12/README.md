# Example

This is an example app using `jest-preset-angular`. It is not supposed to be a boilerplate for an Angular app tested with jest, but could be used as a rough reference for configuration.

The jest configuration itself is located in the `jest.config.js`.

This project was generated with [Angular CLI](https://github.com/angular/angular-cli) version 12.0.0.

## Running unit tests

Run `yarn test` or `npm test` to execute the unit tests via [Jest](https://jestjs.io).

## Running end-to-end tests

End-to-end are not setup in this project.

## Development server

Run `ng serve` for a dev server. Navigate to `http://localhost:4200/`. The app will automatically reload if you change any of the source files.

## Code scaffolding

Run `ng generate component component-name` to generate a new component. You can also use `ng generate directive|pipe|service|class|guard|interface|enum|module`.

## Build

Run `ng build` to build the project. The build artifacts will be stored in the `dist/` directory. Use the `--prod` flag for a production build.
