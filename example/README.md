# Example

This is an example app using `jest-preset-angular`. It is not supposed to be a boilerplate for an Angular app tested with jest, but could be used as a rough reference for configuration.

The jest configuration itself is located in the `package.json`.

This project was generated with [Angular CLI](https://github.com/angular/angular-cli) version 8.3.4.

## Running unit tests

Run `yarn test` or `npm test` to execute the unit tests via [Jest](https://jestjs.io).

## Running end-to-end tests

End-to-end are not setup in this project.

## Development server
